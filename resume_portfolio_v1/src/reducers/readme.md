> Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. 
> Remember that actions only describe what happened, but don't describe how the application's state changes.

> reducer must be pure. Given the same arguments, it should calculate the next state and return it. 
> No surprises. No side effects. No API calls. No mutations. Just a calculation.
