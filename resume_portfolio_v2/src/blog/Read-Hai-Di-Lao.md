I am actually i read this book. I didnt like to read book. I have a negative conotation or attittue towards reading. I think it boring, not very useful. I think is stem from the types books that I was exposed to, such as school textbook, summer reading assignment on fiction books. 

I got to know this book from a friend who work at Hai Di Lao at the moment. I think it is part of my luck to get to know this book exist. This book describes the success of a hotpot company in a extremely competitive market. I was immediately attracted the content. I had not have such intense feeling towards a book in a long time. 

From then on, it help solidified my love for business and my continuation towards reading book. It is personal improvement, non-fictional, business management books that attractes me.
